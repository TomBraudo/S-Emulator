                    S-EMULATOR - REACT WEB CLIENT
                      AI-Assisted Development
===============================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a React-based web client for the S-Emulator system, developed entirely
using AI-assisted development tools (Cursor AI). It provides a modern, 
responsive web interface for the S-program execution engine.


================================================================================
HOW TO RUN THE REACT CLIENT
================================================================================

PREREQUISITES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Node.js and npm must be installed on your system
2. The S-Emulator server must be running on http://localhost:8080/s-emulator/
   (Deploy the server.war file to Apache Tomcat first)


RUNNING THE APPLICATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Navigate to the react-frontend\ folder (this directory)

2. Run the run.bat file by double-clicking it or executing it from command line

3. The batch file will automatically:
   - Install all required npm dependencies (npm install)
   - Start the React development server (npm start)

4. The application will automatically open in your default browser at:
   
   ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
   ║                                                       ║
   ║      >>> http://localhost:3000 <<<                    ║
   ║                                                       ║
   ║   This is the URL to access the React client         ║
   ║                                                       ║
   ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

5. Keep the command window open while using the application

6. To stop the server, press Ctrl+C in the command window

AI-ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
================================================================================

Q1: Which AI tool did you choose to work with and why? Did you try other tools?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I chose to work with Cursor because I already know it pretty well and I know 
how to use it. I did not try other AI tools for this project.


Q2: Were there areas where you felt the AI tool didn't "deliver the goods" and 
    required your intervention as a programmer?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There weren't any parts where I needed to intervene in actual coding. The AI 
did everything by itself, and I only had to instruct it at a high level through 
prompts.


Q3: Did you encounter any bug or requirement that the AI simply couldn't develop?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't encountered any part that I wanted to develop and didn't manage to 
accomplish using Cursor.


Q4: Try to estimate and describe how much of the development (of this client) 
    was performed entirely by the AI alone (i.e., you only formulate prompts; 
    you don't intervene in the code) vs. how much required your intervention 
    and understanding of what was happening.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This client was FULLY developed by the AI. However, of course I needed to 
understand the purpose of each action, otherwise the AI would have been useless.


Q5: How long did it take to develop this interface? Try to estimate if you had 
    to develop it alone without AI support - how long would it have taken you?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The full client development took no more than 5 hours total. If I were to try 
and build this React client by myself with all the relevant styling, it would 
have taken me at least a week.


Q6: Do you have prior familiarity with frontend development? If so, did it help 
    you (in your opinion) in completing the exercise, and how much?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have previous experience developing a web frontend using Cursor in the 
workshop course. It helped me very much here since I developed good practice 
habits when working with AI, and then I got the AI to do exactly what I asked 
for.


Q7: Compared to developing all the exercises in the course - was this AI-driven 
    work style fun for you?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I liked developing the Java backend aspect of the program more, since the 
coding itself is more fun for me than seeing the final product work.

With that said, I like that for backend-focused developers like myself, who 
don't know much about frontend, it feels good that it's possible to develop a 
nice-looking frontend using AI tools by giving high-level prompts.
